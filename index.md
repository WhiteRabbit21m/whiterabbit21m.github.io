This is a Lightning Wallet into a Telegram Bot, but more functionalities have been added:

- /casback command to show a code to get a CashBack from a shop owner
- Notifications of Cards activations
- Integrated full POS service
- POS Link generation for executing POS on an external device
- Scrub service for forwarding all incoming payments to an external address, making the POS actually not custodial if activated
